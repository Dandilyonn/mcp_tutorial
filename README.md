# AI Agents with Tool Calling and MCP Servers Tutorial

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on building AI agents with tool calling capabilities and integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers! This tutorial is designed for students who want to learn how to create intelligent agents that can interact with external tools and services.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. **Understand AI Agents**: Learn the fundamentals of AI agents and their architecture
2. **Implement Tool Calling**: Build agents that can call external tools and APIs
3. **Work with MCP Servers**: Integrate Model Context Protocol servers for enhanced capabilities
4. **Connect to Real APIs**: Use Slack and Google APIs through MCP servers
5. **Build a Complete Agent**: Create a functional agent that can perform real-world tasks
