        self.tools = self._define_tools()
    
    async def call_tool(self, name: str, arguments: Dict[str, Any]):
        # Execute the requested tool
        if name == "geocode_address":
            return self._geocode_address(arguments["address"])
        # ... handle other tools
```

await client.call_tool("geocode_address", {
    "address": "New York, NY"
})
```
**Returns**: Latitude, longitude, formatted address

### 2. 🔄 Reverse Geocode
**Purpose**: Convert coordinates to addresses
```python
await client.call_tool("reverse_geocode", {
    "latitude": 40.7128,
    "longitude": -74.0060
})
```
**Returns**: Human-readable address

### 3. 📏 Calculate Distance
**Purpose**: Find distance between two locations
```python
await client.call_tool("calculate_distance", {
    "lat1": 40.7128, "lng1": -74.0060,
    "lat2": 51.5074, "lng2": -0.1278,
    "unit": "km"
})
```
