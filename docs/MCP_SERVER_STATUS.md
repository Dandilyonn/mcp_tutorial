# MCP Server Status and Availability

## Current State of MCP Servers

As of 2024, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is still in active development. Here's what you need to know:

## âœ… What's Available Now

### Core MCP Package
```bash
pip install mcp
```
The core MCP package is available and provides the foundation for MCP implementations.

### Official MCP Repository
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol
- **Documentation**: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/
- **Specification**: https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/

## ðŸš§ What's in Development

### Official MCP Servers
The following servers are being developed by the MCP community:

1. **Slack MCP Server**
   - Status: In development
   - Repository: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers
   - Features: Send messages, manage channels, handle events

2. **Google APIs MCP Server**
   - Status: In development
   - Features: Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, Sheets

3. **GitHub MCP Server**
   - Status: In development
   - Features: Repository management, issues, pull requests

4. **File System MCP Server**
   - Status: In development
   - Features: File operations, directory management

## ðŸ”§ What We're Using in This Tutorial

Since official MCP servers are still in development, our tutorial uses:

### Mock MCP Servers
We've created mock implementations that demonstrate:
- How MCP servers work conceptually
- The correct patterns and interfaces
- Integration with AI agents
- Error handling and validation

### Real MCP Integration
When official servers become available, you can easily replace our mock implementations with real ones by:

1. Installing the official server packages
2. Updating the server initialization code
3. Configuring real API credentials

## ðŸš€ How to Get Real MCP Servers

### Option 1: Wait for Official Releases
- Monitor the [MCP GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)
- Check for official package releases
- Follow the MCP community announcements

### Option 2: Build Your Own MCP Server
You can build your own MCP server using the specification:

```python
# Example of a basic MCP server structure
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server

class MyMCPServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.server = Server("my-server")
        # Define your tools and resources
        
    def list_tools(self):
        # Return available tools
        pass
        
    def call_tool(self, name, arguments):
        # Execute tool logic
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server = MyMCPServer()
    stdio_server(server.server)
```

### Option 3: Use Community Implementations
- Check the MCP community for unofficial implementations
- Look for server implementations in the MCP ecosystem
- Contribute to existing server projects

## ðŸ“š Learning Path

### Phase 1: Learn with Mock Servers (Current)
- Understand MCP concepts and patterns
- Learn tool calling and agent integration
- Practice with our mock implementations

### Phase 2: Build Your Own Servers
- Create MCP servers for your specific needs
- Integrate with your existing APIs and services
- Contribute to the MCP ecosystem

### Phase 3: Use Official Servers (Future)
- Install and configure official MCP servers
- Replace mock implementations with real ones
- Build production applications

## ðŸ”— Useful Resources

### Official Resources
- [MCP Specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/)
- [MCP GitHub Repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)
- [MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)

### Community Resources
- [MCP Discord/Slack communities]
- [MCP blog and announcements]
- [Community server implementations]

### Development Tools
- [MCP SDK for Python](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
- [MCP Testing Tools](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/testing)
- [MCP Examples](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/examples)

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Recommendation

For learning purposes, our mock implementations are perfect because they:
- Demonstrate all the key concepts
- Work immediately without external dependencies
- Show the correct patterns and interfaces
- Can be easily replaced with real implementations later

When you're ready to build production applications, you can:
1. Build your own MCP servers for your specific needs
2. Wait for official servers to be released
3. Use community implementations

The knowledge you gain from this tutorial will be directly applicable to real MCP servers when they become available!
